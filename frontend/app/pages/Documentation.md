## Demo Documentation

### RAG System

The RAG system is a retrieval-augmented generation system that uses a large language model (LLM) to generate responses to user queries. 

The system is designed to upload relevant documents, process and load them in a vector database (Pinecone). These documents are then used to retrieve relevant information to generate responses to user queries. OpenIA embdebbing model is used to generate the vector representation of the documents, so the system can use the most relevant documents using cosine similarity.

The system uses a RAG model to combine the retrieved documents with the user query and generate a response. 

### Chat with History

The chat with history system is a conversational agent that uses a large language model (LLM) to generate responses to user queries.

Chat history is stored in the session state, so the system can use the context of the conversation to generate more relevant responses. The system uses a pre-trained model to generate responses, so the quality of the responses depends on the quality of the model.

The system support **multi-lingual conversations**, so it can generate responses in different languages. 

### Advanced Features

The example simulates a movie critic assistant, using a rating system trained with few-shot examples. 

The model can also be tuned to generate responses for specific tasks or domains, so it can generate more relevant responses. The system uses a pre-trained model to generate responses, so the quality of the responses depends on the quality of the model.

### Multi Agent

The example use a multi-agent system to generate responses to user queries. The assistan simulated a travel assistant, using a multi-agent system to suggest locations, search for interesting places and weather conditions.

## System Performance

### Retrieval accuracy and relevance

Retrieval quality is based on the queality of the documents. Uploading raw docuements is not a good idea, as the system might not recognize header, footers or other non relevant information. 

To improve the vector representation of the documents, is better to run cluster analysis and explore documents chunks that overlap in the same cluster. This way, the system can use the most relevant chunks to generate the vector representation of the document.

Include the user feedback in the request history help to improve the quality of the responses. The system can use the feedback to improve the model and the rates of the responses.

### LLM response quality

The system uses a pre-trained model to generate responses, so the quality of the responses depends on the quality of the model. The model used in this system is a large language model, so it should be able to generate high-quality responses. However, the quality of the responses can be affected by the quality of the training data, the size of the model, and the complexity of the task. The system could be improved by fine-tuning the model on a specific task or domain to improve the quality of the responses.

OpenAi gtp-4o is one of the best rated model at the moment for general use, so it should be able to generate high-quality responses. However, the quality of the responses can be affected by the quality of the training data, the size of the model, and the complexity of the task. The system could be improved by fine-tuning the model on a specific task or domain to improve the quality of the responses.

### System latency and efficiency

Latency could be improved using local models or using a cache system to store the responses. The system could also be improved by using a queue system to handle the requests, so it can handle more requests at the same time.

The frontend based in streamlit is not designed for performance, so it could be improved by using a more performant frontend, like React or Angular.

## Ethical considerations and mitigation strategies for your system.

### Ethical consideration

* Data privacy: How data is collected, stored, and used can impact user privacy and data security. 
* Transparency: Users should be informed about the potential impact of AI tools, including how they contribute to care, their benefits and limitations, and any concerns. 
* Bias and fairness: AI systems should be designed to treat all individuals fairly, without bias or discrimination. However, algorithms can be influenced by their creators' preferences or perpetuate existing biases in data, which can lead to discriminatory or biased content. 
* Accountability: Developers and users should be held accountable for the decisions made by AI systems to ensure they are used responsibly and any negative consequences are addressed. This can be especially challenging when generative AI is used to create content that is shared publicly, as it can be difficult to hold creators accountable if the content is harmful or offensive. 

### Mitigation strategies

Depending on the specific use case, there are several strategies that can be used to address these ethical considerations:
* Testing frameworks: Developers can use testing frameworks to evaluate the performance of AI systems and identify potential biases or ethical concerns. This can help ensure that the system is fair and accurate, and that it does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases.
* Online monitoring: AI systems can be monitored online to identify and address any harmful or offensive content that is generated. This can help prevent the spread of misinformation or harmful content, and ensure that users are protected from harmful or offensive content.
* User feedback: Users can provide feedback on the content generated by AI systems to help identify any potential issues or concerns. This can help developers improve the system and address any ethical concerns that arise.
* Human-in-the-loop: Human moderators can be used to review and approve content generated by AI systems to ensure that it is accurate, fair, and appropriate. This can help prevent harmful or offensive content from being shared publicly, and ensure that users are protected from harmful or offensive content.

### RAG

* Current implementation only support similarity searches. Searcg could be improved by using an hybrid searches, that combine similarity and metadata.
* The system uses a calcualted id based on fielname and chuck. This could be improved by using a hash of the file content, so it performs better on docuemnt updates. 

### Chat with History

* Short-term memory is stored in the session state. This could be improved by using a database to store the memory, so it can be used in different sessions across differente servers.
* Long-term memory could be added to the system, so it can store information for longer periods of time, using summarization to keep updated information from past sessions without storing the whole conversation.

### Tuneable model

* Multi-model support could be added to the system, so it can use different models from different vendor for different tasks.
* Few-shot learning could be added to the system, so it can learn from few examples and improve the quality of the responses. Analyzing the user feedback can be used to improve the model and rates.
* Fine-tuning could be added to the system, so it can improve the quality of the responses for a specific task or domain. This could be done by using a smaller model and training it on a specific dataset, which save money and time (reduced latency).

### Multi Agent

* Some LLM-based agents for procedures esxecuted locallly will improve the performance of the system, as it will reduce the latency of the responses.
* Use LLM as a tool to solve specific tasks, like generating code or summarizing documents. Is not a good idea to use LLM for all the tasks, as it could be expensive and slow.
* Conditional edges can be improved using more comple state records. For example, keeping records of executed agents in the state.
